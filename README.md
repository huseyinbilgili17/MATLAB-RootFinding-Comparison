# MATLAB-RootFinding-Comparison
A MATLAB-based implementation and comparison of numerical root-finding methods, including Newton-Raphson, Secant, Regula Falsi, Fixed Point, and Müller’s Method. Evaluates each method based on convergence rate, CPU time, and iteration count.

This project compares multiple numerical methods to find the roots of a nonlinear equation:

> **f(x) = x² - 4e⁻ˣ - 3**

Implemented Methods:
- Newton-Raphson
- Secant Method
- Regula Falsi (False Position)
- Fixed Point Iteration
- Müller's Method

Features:
- Root calculation with each method
- Convergence rate estimation
- CPU time measurement
- Comparison table of results

Requirements:
- MATLAB or GNU Octave
